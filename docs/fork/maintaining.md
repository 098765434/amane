# Maintaining the fork

How the fork is kept on top of upstream, which commits make up each feature, and the housekeeping
rules. What each feature does is in the [index](README.md).

The fork is never upstreamed. It is kept cheap to rebase instead: one commit, or a few, per
feature, fork code in files of its own, and as few lines as can be in upstream's files.

## Provenance

| | |
|---|---|
| Upstream | `https://github.com/MystiaFin/amane` (remote: `upstream`) |
| Fork point | upstream commit `544cbfc` (tags `fork-base` and `fork-base-2026-11-07`), upstream's `main` on 2026-11-07 |
| Before that | `72e23eb` (tag `fork-base-2026-10-16`), the commit the fork was first written against; that history is kept on `ocbk-pre-tidy` |
| Fork branch | `ocbk`; the fork's `main` mirrors upstream's `main` (fast-forward it: `git push origin upstream/main:main`) |
| The delta | `git log --oneline fork-base..ocbk` |

The fork point is a real upstream commit, so `git log fork-base..HEAD` and `git range-diff` line
up against genuine upstream history. `ocbk-pre-tidy` stays on origin so the revisions amane-shell
pinned before the rebase can still be fetched.

Branches: `ocbk` is the only work branch, and `main` only follows upstream.

## Upstream files stay as they were

All fork documentation lives in `docs/fork/`. Upstream's mdBook (`docs/src/`) and
`ARCHITECTURE.md` are byte-identical to `fork-base`, in every fork commit, not only at the tip;
the fork's additions to them are in [`docs/fork/`](README.md) instead. Only two upstream-adjacent
files change: a one-line banner in `README.md`, and the root `FORK.md` stub. Check it with:

```sh
git diff --stat fork-base HEAD -- docs/src ARCHITECTURE.md   # prints nothing
```

One upstream file is removed: `examples/text_stroke.rs` calls a `Text::stroke` that upstream
hasn't committed, so it doesn't build upstream either
(`95aa453`). Bring it back when upstream adds the method.

`Cargo.lock` conflicts on nearly every rebase: take upstream's, then let cargo add the fork's
crates back.

## Where a rebase conflicts

By lines added, measured against the fork point before (`72e23eb`) and after (`544cbfc`) the
Phase 12 tidy, which moved fork code out into files of its own:

| File | Hunks (lines added) before | After |
|---|---|---|
| `graphics/gpu/paint.rs` | 24 (+764) | 18 (+77): the shapes are in `paint/shapes.rs` |
| `graphics/gpu/quads/draw.rs` | 11 (+566) | 6 (+31): the fork's tests are in `draw/fork_tests.rs` |
| `graphics/gpu/quads/batch.rs` | 22 (+332) | 19 (+79): the shapes are in `quads/shapes.rs` |
| `compositor/niri.rs` | 22 (+628) | 17 (+229): `niri/{ipc,listen,events}.rs` |
| `graphics/path.rs` | 14 (+401) | 12 (+54): `path/trim.rs` |
| `wayland/dropped.rs` | 38 (+388) | 34 (+161): `dropped/drag.rs` |
| `wayland/keyboard.rs` | 20 (+165) | 20 (+103): `keyboard/target.rs` |
| `widgets/text_input/field.rs` | 26 (+782) | 26 (+782), fork-owned |
| `wayland/normal.rs` | 30 (+243) | 30 (+243), fork-owned |
| `graphics/font.rs` | 39 (+86) | 39 (+86), fork-owned |

The moves are commits at the tip, so they cut the conflicts of future fork work, not those of the
commits before them: a rebase still replays the earlier commits that wrote the code in the
upstream file. List the files again with:

```sh
git diff --stat fork-base HEAD -- src Cargo.lock | sort -t'|' -k2 -rn | head -20
```

### Fork-owned files

These upstream files are now mostly the fork's: `src/widgets/text_input/field.rs` (selection,
undo, chords, secrets, multiline, the input method), `src/graphics/font.rs` (fontique and parley
in place of the fontconfig lookup), `src/wayland/normal.rs` (app windows) and
`src/widgets/scroll_area/offsets.rs` (coasting, the end of the content). On a conflict there, take
the fork's side, then port what upstream meant by hand. A security fix needs the most care:
upstream's `f6a96b8` clears a password field after submit, which the fork does in
`text_input/targets.rs` by wiping the field (`fields::take`), with tests.

### Upstream's single submit

Upstream submits each frame's GPU work once (`e2e29c9`): passes write into the frame's encoder
(`take_encoder`/`keep_encoder` in `graphics/gpu/encoder.rs`) and `submit()` mails it before
vello and at present. Fork code that draws must do the same, or it runs ahead of the frame's
earlier work. Two places need more: `Quads::letter` submits the frame so far before the glyph
atlas starts over, since a queue's texture writes land ahead of any encoder submitted after them;
and the fork's GPU tests draw through a helper that submits.

## Lints

The lints in `Cargo.toml` (`[lints.rust]`, `[lints.clippy]`) are ones the whole crate already
passes, upstream's code included. A lint upstream's code fails is allowed there for the crate,
with the reason beside it (`needless_range_loop`, for upstream's image filters), rather than with
an attribute in an upstream file, which a rebase would have to carry.

The fork's own files hold themselves to more: each module file the fork added starts with

```rust
#![warn(clippy::unwrap_used, clippy::dbg_macro, clippy::todo)]
```

and its submodules inherit it. Give a new fork module the same line. `clippy.toml` allows
`unwrap` and `dbg!` in tests. CI (`.github/workflows/fork.yml`) runs clippy with `-D warnings`.

KDE Connect, phone messages, adb and the status-item client were written here and moved to
amane-shell (`amane-phone`, `amane-status`) in its Phase 9. The tidy took them out of every commit
rather than keeping them and their removal; the generic pieces they brought (D-Bus conversions,
`Bus::emit_to`, the `ScrollArea` end, a multiline input that sends with Enter, video frames) stayed.

## Reviewing the fork

```sh
git log --oneline --stat fork-base..ocbk     # every fork commit and the files it touched
git diff --stat fork-base..ocbk              # the whole delta, by file
git diff fork-base..ocbk -- <paths>          # one feature (paths in the commit map)
```

## Consumed by

The [`amane-shell`](https://github.com/098765434/amane-shell) bar, as a git dependency pinned to a
`rev` on this branch. For local co-development the shell carries a git-ignored
`.cargo/local.toml` with `paths = ["../amane"]`, used as `cargo --config .cargo/local.toml …`
(`cargo clippy --config …` for clippy, which doesn't see a `--config` given before it).

The upstream `amane` *CLI* uses its own bundled library copy in `~/.cache/amane/library`, not
this fork.

## Rebasing onto newer upstream

The same routine as the niri fork's:

1. **Tag the new base.** `git fetch upstream`, then `git tag fork-base-<date> upstream/main`.
   Keep the branch as it was: `git branch -f ocbk-pre-tidy ocbk` and push it, so revisions
   pinned before the rebase stay fetchable.
2. **Make a reference merge.** On a scratch branch, `git merge upstream/main` into `ocbk` and
   resolve it once. Build it, run the tests, and build amane-shell against it. Its tree is what the
   rebase must end with.
3. **Rebase.** `git rebase --onto fork-base-<date> fork-base ocbk`. Resolve each conflict toward
   the reference merge; on a fork-owned file, take the fork's side and port upstream's intent.
   Afterwards, `git diff <reference> ocbk` must be empty, or show only what was decided on purpose.
4. **Check every commit.** `git rebase -x 'cargo check --all-targets' fork-base-<date>`, putting
   `Cargo.lock` back after each check (cargo rewrites it), then fmt, clippy with and without
   `polkit-agent`, `cargo test --lib`, the GPU tests (`-- --ignored`) and `nix build` at the tip.
5. **Compare.** `git range-diff <old fork-base>..ocbk-pre-tidy fork-base-<date>..ocbk`: what changed
   in each commit beyond the conflicts.
6. **Move `fork-base`** to the new base, check that `docs/src` and `ARCHITECTURE.md` still match
   it, fast-forward the fork's `main`, force-push `ocbk` with a lease, and update this page's
   commit map (the hashes change).
7. **Bump amane-shell**: the `rev`, and the `outputHashes` entry in its `flake.nix`.
8. **A live session** with the shell on the new revision: text fields and password fill, popups,
   gestures, glass.

## Keeping the fork light

- Put new features in their own module; a feature in an upstream file goes in a child module
  (`foo.rs` declares `mod bar;` for `foo/bar.rs`), leaving a `mod` line and a call behind.
- Keep edits to existing files surgical and additive. Keep upstream's API too: `spawn(&str)`
  stays, as upstream has it, while new code uses `Launch`.
- Document each feature under `docs/fork/<area>/`, starting with **Usage**, then
  **Design / internals**, and add a row to the [index](README.md). Never edit `docs/src/` or
  `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- Implemented specs move to [`design/`](README.md#design-history) with a "Status: implemented"
  header.
- Each feature is one commit, or a few that sit together; fold its docs into it.
