# IPC (fork additions)

What the fork changes on upstream's [IPC](../../src/ipc.md) page: a socket per app-id instead of
one per session, a single running copy of each app, and calling another app. Upstream had one
socket, `amane.sock`, and a second listener stopped with `amane is already running`.

## Usage

### One copy at a time

Each app listens on its own socket, named after its app-id ([`App::app_id`](../windows/app-windows.md#an-app-of-its-own)):

| App-id | Socket in `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` |
|---|---|
| `amane`, the default and the shell's | `amane.sock` |
| `amane-settings` | `amane-settings.sock` |
| `org.example.Notes` | `amane-org.example.Notes.sock` |

So the shell and your apps listen side by side, and only one copy of each runs. Starting an app whose socket already answers doesn't start a second copy: the new launch hands its arguments to the running copy and exits, printing `amane: <app id> is already running, it takes this launch`. The running copy then:

- runs `App::on_activate(handler)` with the new launch's arguments, like a file to open, or
- without `on_activate`, brings its window to the front, opening it again if it was closed (an app kept running by `App::keep_alive`).

When the launch came from a launcher with an activation token, the running copy's window takes the focus with it ([Activation](../windows/activation.md)). From a terminal there's no token, and the compositor decides.

```rust,ignore
fn main() {
    App::new()
        .app_id("amane-notes")
        .normal_window("main", main_window)
        .on_activate(|files| {
            for file in files {
                let file = file.clone();

                open_window_with(file.clone(), move || note(&file));
            }
        })
        .run();
}
```

`amane run` checks for a running shell first and says so in your terminal, and `amane restart` stops the running shell before starting the new one. `amane dev` restarts its own shell, but it can't stop a shell started some other way. Stop your everyday shell (the one from `amane run`) before running `amane dev`.

For a window that should run as many copies as it's started, use `App::new().without_ipc()`. It listens on no socket, so `on_activate` and IPC handlers aren't used.

### Calling another app

`amane ipc call --app <app id> <name> [arguments...]` calls a handler in the app with that app-id instead of the shell. From Rust, `amane::ipc_call(app_id, name, arguments)` does the same and returns the reply, so an app can ask the shell to do something:

```rust,ignore
// a settings app telling the shell to look at its settings again
let _ = amane::ipc_call("amane", "reload", &[]);
```

`ipc_call` waits for the reply, which an Amane app gives within a second. It returns an error when that app isn't running.

## Design / internals

- `ipc_socket_for(app_id)` names the socket. The IPC socket is one of the event loop's three
  sources: `amane ipc call <name>` from a terminal, or another app's `ipc_call`.
- Before any window opens, `run()` checks whether the app's socket already answers. If it does,
  it hands the launch to that running copy (`hand_over` in `src/app.rs`, an `activate` call
  carrying the activation token, then argv) and returns. So only one copy of each app-id runs.
- History: phase 6 of [App windows](../windows/app-windows.md#phase-6-apps-as-separate-processes-done) (`82337f2`).
